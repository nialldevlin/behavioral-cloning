# BehavioralCloning
A project to train a neural network to drive in a car simulator

## Overview
This project is contained in three main files: preprocess.py, model.py, and drive.py. The preprocess.py augments the entire dataset and stores it in a numpy array (.npy) file, which was not uploaded due to large size (15GB). Model.py reads in the dataset and trains the model, then stores the model in model.h5. Drive.py then drives the car in the simulator based on the predicted steering angle from the model.
